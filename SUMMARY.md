# Project Summary: MyRiscvOSPy

## Overview

MyRiscvOSPy is a Python-based implementation of a multitasking scheduler for RISC-V architecture, developed for an Advanced Computer Architecture (ACAD) course. The project simulates a RISC-V processor and implements various scheduling algorithms to manage multiple tasks.

## Key Components

1. **Core Simulator**
   - RISC-V processor simulation with registers, memory, and execution capabilities
   - Interrupt controller for handling timer and external interrupts
   - Memory model with read/write operations for bytes, halfwords, and words

2. **Scheduler Implementations**
   - Base scheduler with common functionality for task management
   - Priority-based preemptive scheduler
   - Round-robin scheduler with time slicing
   - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduler
   - Aging mechanism to prevent starvation of lower-priority tasks

3. **Task Management**
   - Task creation, termination, blocking, and sleeping
   - Context switching between tasks
   - Sample tasks for testing the scheduler

4. **User Interface**
   - Command-line interface for interacting with the simulator
   - Visualization utilities for monitoring task states
   - Task state graph for visualizing task transitions

5. **Utilities**
   - RISC-V instruction disassembler for debugging
   - Test cases for verifying scheduler and disassembler functionality

## Features Implemented

- **Context Switching**: Save and restore task states including registers and program counters
- **Preemptive Multitasking**: Use timer interrupts to preempt running tasks
- **Priority-Based Scheduling**: Execute tasks based on their priority levels
- **Aging Mechanism**: Prevent starvation of lower-priority tasks
- **Blocking and Sleeping**: Support for tasks that voluntarily yield CPU
- **Time Slicing**: Implement round-robin scheduling for fair CPU allocation
- **Cooperative Multitasking**: Support for tasks that voluntarily yield control
- **System Calls and Interrupt Handling**: Manage tasks and respond to hardware events
- **Process State Visualization**: Monitor and visualize task states

## Future Enhancements

1. **GUI Implementation**
   - Develop a graphical user interface using Tkinter or PyQt
   - Visualize task states, CPU usage, and memory usage in real-time

2. **Web Dashboard**
   - Create a web-based dashboard using Flask or Django
   - Monitor and control the scheduler remotely

3. **Additional Scheduling Algorithms**
   - Implement more advanced scheduling algorithms like Multilevel Feedback Queue
   - Add support for real-time scheduling algorithms

4. **Enhanced RISC-V Simulation**
   - Implement more RISC-V instructions and extensions
   - Add support for floating-point operations
   - Implement a more realistic memory hierarchy with caches

5. **Inter-Process Communication**
   - Add support for message passing between tasks
   - Implement semaphores and mutexes for synchronization

## Conclusion

MyRiscvOSPy provides a solid foundation for understanding multitasking operating systems and scheduling algorithms in the context of RISC-V architecture. The project can be used as an educational tool for learning about operating system concepts, RISC-V architecture, and Python programming.
